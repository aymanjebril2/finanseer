            Why?

          <Typography align="left" color="textSecondary" paragraph>
            Personal finance education is very important but not something
            thatâ€™s not covered in the core education curriculum. There is also a
            stigma associated with talking about money, which we want to
            eradicate.

            The idea and the initial phases of this application were done in a
            Hackathon! The group came together quickly, hashed out the idea and
            the initial scope and implemented initial functionality within 48
            hours!
